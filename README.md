# Introduction to R

This project contains the material for an introductory course in R.

The material is organised in Markdown files. 
Each session contains Markdown files that are missing some code for students to try it themselves, as
well as a complete solution.

Session 2 contains two versions of the Rmd files. One version uses the
 old dplyr gather() and spread(), the other uses pivot_*().
